# Ansible based Quoybte installer 

This approach mimics a manual Quobyte install without taking any shortcut using the official Quobyte installer shell script.

It install only a "pure" Quobyte cluster and does not do any optimization or install any third party tools like NTP daemon, numactl, 
network-tuning tool or things like that.

Thus it gives you a better understanding of what is needed to only install a Quoybte cluster.
